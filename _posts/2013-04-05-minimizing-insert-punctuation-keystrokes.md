title: Minimizing Insert-Punctuation Keystrokes
---

Some of [Xah Lee's](http://xahlee.org/PageTwo_dir/Personal_dir/Xah_Lee_Resume.html) posts trickle down to me through the Emacs blogs I subscribe to. One such article that made it to my living room is his take on [punctuation in the English language](http://xahlee.info/kbd/tiny_space_bar_japanese_keyboard.html), obviously influenced by his multilingualism. (You read the article now, or at least browse it casually, so you understand how far off I was when I proceed to the rest of this post.)

Before I figured out what he was talking about, my mind came to the conclusion that indeed, typing a space after a comma *is* a waste. But not a waste of space! I thought his real concern was the wasted keystroke (as so many Emacs users are wont to dispel). Even though I was way off about the article, I had planted a seed, and it hasn't died since. Now *my* concern is the millions of wasted keystrokes I've been content to type since I started computing. Why is it necessary to manually insert spaces after typing punctuation? In plain English, when is it ever appropriate to follow a punctuation mark with a non-whitespace character?

...It's not! And it won't be. (Wait, did you see what I did there?) Given the trivial nature of conforming Emacs to my preferences, it would be a snap to write

But how crazy is that? Honestly, it makes me feel a little insane. I'm a little afraid to try it for some substantial length of time, for the same reason I was [afraid of trying dvorak](http://ericscrosson.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/adios-dvorak/): I don't want to sound like a sailor every time I sit down at another keyboard, growing frustrated at my lack of typing coordination. Maybe I'll give it a shot, maybe I'll only enable it in certain Major Modes (`fundamental`, `org`, `text`). When I decide how to handle this nascent idea appropriately, I'll be sure to revisit the topic on this blog. The inception has begun, and now it's in your mind too. Cheers!
