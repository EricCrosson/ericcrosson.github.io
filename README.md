# Poole

Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site
generator. It's designed and developed by
[@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise
foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a
full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and
styles.
